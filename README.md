# Inventory-Management-System
An application built with the help of Python Tkinter. 
The application was built as pat of the software engineering course of my B.Tech Degree. With the help of Tkinter a GUI was built for the user to interact with. The Inventory Management System was built by keeping in mind the small shopkeepers and their necessity to keep track of their inventory on a daily basis. The system handles all the items through a sqlite3 database and a python backend.
